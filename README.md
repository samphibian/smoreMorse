S'more Morse is a hardware hack for PennApps 2017. Everyone loves codes and puzzles and nostalgia is making a comeback, so what better way to combine those with the modern age than with a lovely desk artwork that not only displays your notes, motivational quotes, or office insults, but also communicates them in morse code?

The hardware is an Arduino Leonardo with an LCD shield on top. The two files are separate due to it not being feasible to really combine them, especially since the materials need to be returned.
The morse code is performed by an RGB light that goes from one color to another with the dashes and dots.
